## Overview

Gear Protocol is designed to facilitate seamless interactions between decentralized applications through an actor-based architecture. The Vara Network serves as a robust layer for hosting and executing smart contracts, providing a reliable environment for developers to build and deploy applications.

## Features

- **Actor-Based Architecture:** Utilize the actor model for efficient message passing and inter-program communication.
- **Decentralization:** Build applications that run on a decentralized network, ensuring trust and security.
- **Scalability:** Leverage the Vara Network’s capabilities to handle multiple transactions and processes simultaneously.
- **Open Source:** This project encourages collaboration and contributions from the community.
